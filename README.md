## Launching the mini-shell

1. Cleaning up previous compilation files:
```bash
make clean 
```

2. Compile the project:
```bash
make
```

3. Launching the mini-shell:
```bash
./myenv
```

## Using the mini-shell

Once the mini-shell is launched, you can enter commands just like in a regular terminal. Here are some example commands you can use:
- `ls` : lists files and directories in the current directory.
- `pwd` : displays the path of the current directory.
- `exit` : exits the mini-shell.
- `env` : displays the current environment variables.
- ...

See other possible commands directly in the [wiki](https://github.com/angele-d/Mini-Shell/wiki) of the project   
:warning: The wiki is in french language, but you can use a translator if needed.
